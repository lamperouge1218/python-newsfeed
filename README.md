## Description

This is a practice application used to learn the processes of backend development using Python. It is a Tech News app that allows users to login and make posts with links to articles or other resources. It uses Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy for the database storage of Users, Posts, Comments, and Votes, and uses bcrypt to handle hashing user passwords before they are entered into the database. 

Here is a screenshot of the deployed app:
